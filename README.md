# About

Simple CMS for maintaining a blog.

I wanted something exclusive and unique to provide a platform for my blog and I also wanted to learn React.
The best way to learn a tech stack is to use it, so I did. My primitive CMS was born.
Basic features include adding/editing/deleting posts and photo galleries. 
Planned features include handling comments and integrating other social media functions to allow reader engagement.

This project uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS).
Although this project doesn't use Redux/Router at the moment, it might be refactored to do so at a later point in time.
(I didn't like the idea of jumping to those libraries straight away. 
They are not a part of core react, so one should be able to write something neat without them.)

# Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `. .drawdeps`

Draws a basic dependency graph of the React components used. 
It does not include external libraries in the output graph.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `nodemon server.js`

Runs the dev server.<br>
Open [http://localhost:4000/feed](http://localhost:4000/feed) to view the feed API endpoint.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
